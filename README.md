# oCEO Management System

This repository contains a simple yet elegant implementation of the on-Campus Employment Opportunities (oCEO) at IITGN. It facilitates easy creation and deletion of jobs by the faculty offering them, and an easy view of payment processing status for a student availing the opportunity.

## Front End:
Our frontend, developed using Flask, Flex and Bootstrap, facilitates easy user experience and takes into account the needs of each user separately. \
\

## Back End:
Our backend is based on flask in python. It uses flask inbuilt methods to redirect and route our pages on the webapp.\

*How to use?* \
Go into the ```main_project``` folder, and, if running for the first time, run ```insert_passwords.py``` file. After this, run ```main_app.py``` file, and create a new student/professor user using the ```New User``` button. After this, login using created credentials through the ```Student``` or ```Professor``` buttons. After login, you can view various operations that can be done for that particular usertype.
