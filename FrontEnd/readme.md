*involved collaborators:* 
- Animesh Tumne

*How to use?*
Currently, there are two folders:

To see how we can connect our database to the FrontEnd, peek into the user1_testing folder
- run user1_select_testing.py
- After running, you can have a look at how various SQL queries can be integrated into the existing framework.

To see what pages our management system contains, peek into the loginpage_testing folder
- Run loginpage_testing.py and explore it as you wish.
- After exploration, have a look at the source code to understand the mechanics.
